projects:
- title: "Financial Document Analysis using LLM’s"
  subtitle: "University of Arizona"
  date: "2025"
  details: |
    Developed and tuned prompts for LLMs to extract key investment themes, market outlooks, and portfolio strategies from unstructured financial narratives for a financial services firm, doubling extraction accuracy.
    Designed and implemented a custom rating system to evaluate the accuracy and quality of LLM-generated insights from hedge fund partner letters.
    Produced structured, investor-ready analysis to enable hedge fund managers to benchmark strategies against peer and top-performing investor communications.

- title: "GNN’s for Node Level Regression"
  subtitle: "Material Informatics LAb, UOA"
  date: "2025"
  details: |
    Designed and implemented multiple Graph Neural Network architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GIN) to perform node-level regression for predicting localized stress in material structures.
    Optimized model performance through dropout, batch normalization, skip connections, and hyperparameter tuning, achieving improvements in prediction accuracy.
    Utilized the university’s HPC cluster for parallel and efficient training of large-scale GNN models on complex graphs
